# Next Step

Next Step intends to complement existing various smart contract tools ecosystems with an efficient way to model and execute business process models

Current most smart contract use cases-most notably supply chains- is executing business processes that go well beyond one business Entity into a process contributed to by various participants.
Existing business models do exits- and have been for quiet sometime- most notably bpmn 2.0, which is a well established standard with version 2.0 that is quiet stable for a decade now, with main target audience the mangaerial staff, along with programmers etc.
Only problem is existing Business Process Execution engines, from big players, SAP, IBM, Oracle, Redhat, and non standard AWS, also open source like Camunda, Redhat, and Bonitasoft etc, they are all centralized servers with common issues, like TRUST, security, maintenence, IT setup, etc.

Next Step is a Parachain that executes Business Process Models directly, to be used by managerial audience; managers, business analysts, normal employees, etc. Next Step can be integrated to be called say from EVM solidity smart contracts using precompiled contract interfaces to check for process status, enter task data and mark as done, etc.

-Also included is set in S T O N E . a small dapp to model business processes, start and monitor their execution. N tech background is needed.

## typical usage scenario;
managerial audience to use standard bpmn modeler tools, or 'set in S T O N E .' dApp ui to model the process, then call next-step pallet extrinsic to 

#### assign roles to accounts - for demo
### start process from bpmn model files
### step through process and monitor execution 


## Getting Started

```
# run next-step parachain
docker-compose up

# open set-in-stone
# http://localhost

# open polakdot ui
# http://localhost:8080

```
### set in S T O N E .
#### open in your browser http://localhost:8080
